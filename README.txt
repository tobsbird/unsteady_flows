This project will print visualizations with contour lines. 

To change the 3d image file being opened and read, go to line 187 and change the file manually.

The new keyboard functions for this project are:
	"e" = allows the user to type in a point in the mesh and a streamline will be created from that point.
	"t" = generates streamline-based visualization using a point in the center of every quad.
	"w" = finds and draws a dot at every singularity and prints out the classification of each singularity in the mesh.
